  "story_archetype": "Born in the glow of forge-lit factories, the Modular Maverick drifts across concrete canyons armed with portable climate hubs like relics of future utopias. They weld zero-carbon veins into sleeping giants of steel and glass, toppling fossil titans one duct at a time. They speak in torque, dream in phases, and carry an eco-rebellion banner stitched from sparks and sweat—declaring every building’s birthright to green comfort.",
